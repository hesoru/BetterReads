# BetterReads
### Reading is good for you, but we can make it *better*.

Our application is an intelligent, social book discovery platform tailored to passionate readers who want a more engaging and personalized experience than traditional apps like Goodreads. It allows users to explore and write reviews for books; receive personalized reading recommendations; and curate reading wishlists. By storing book metadata, user preferences, and behavioral insights, the platform delivers a highly individualized user experience. Built on MongoDB, it features account management, a natural language processing (NLP)â€“powered search engine, a reading recommendation system, and interactive user features.

### Key features

1. The **Book Details page** displays comprehensive information about the selected book, including its title, description, genres, ISBN and more. It also lists all reviews related to the book. Users have the ability to write a new, review or delete and edit their existing review.

2. The **Book Search page** allows users to search for books using keywords and filter their results by genre. Users can click on an individual book card to navigate to its detail page. Additionally, users can click on the heart icon to add the book to their wishlist.

3. The **User Profile page** displays the user's information and the books in their wishlist. Users can also update their password directly from this page. If the user is not signed up, then the page is defaulted to a guest profile, which also displays the booklist of their guest session with the option to sign up and persist the booklist from their guest session into the wishlist of the created user account.

4. The **Book Recommendation page** displays book recommendations for users based on their previous review ratings. By default, if the user is new without any reviews, the recomendations are displayed based on their favorite genres selected upon signup. If the user is not signed up, the recommendations displayed are based on book popularity by default.

5. The **AI Match page** allows users to describe what they'd like to read in short sentences, with optional filters to narrow down candidates based on publication year ranges and genres. Books in our database are first filtered by genre/publication year if applicable, then Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used to compute the semantic similarity between the user's input and each of the filtered candidate books. Books are returned and sorted by their cosine similarity score in descending order.
