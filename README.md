### Reading is good for you, but we can make it *better*.

**Team 25 - Datababes**

**Team members:** Oreoluwa Akinwunmi, Renbo Xu, Helena Sokolovska, and Marvel Hariadi

Our application is an intelligent, social book discovery platform tailored to passionate readers who want a more engaging and personalized experience than traditional apps like Goodreads. It allows users to explore and write reviews for books; receive personalized reading recommendations; and curate reading wishlists. By storing book metadata, user preferences, and behavioral insights, the platform delivers a highly individualized user experience. Built on MongoDB, it features account management, a natural language processing (NLP)â€“powered search engine, a reading recommendation system, and interactive user features.
