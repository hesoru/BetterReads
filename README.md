### App Description
Our application is an intelligent, social book discovery platform tailored to passionate readers who want a more engaging and personalized experience than traditional apps like Goodreads. It allows users to explore, review and write review for books; receive customized recommendations; and create personalized reading wishlists. By storing book metadata, user preferences, and behavioral insights, the platform delivers a highly individualized user experience. Built on MongoDB, it features account management, a natural language processing (NLP)â€“powered search engine, a recommendation system, and interactive user features.
